                            <strong>TurbOmics</strong> is a web-based platform designed to streamline the multi-omics
                            analysis of metabolomics data with proteomics and transcriptomics. The platform supports
                            data from targeted-based experiments or those where the metabolite's identification is
                            available (i.e. NMR- or gas chromatography coupled to MS-based experiments). Furthermore,
                            TurbOmics enables users to putatively annotate untargeted metabolomics features based on
                            their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio. Within TurbOmics, researchers can perform exploratory data
                            analysis and multi-omics integration using the <em>Multi-Omics Factor Analysis</em>,
                            <em>Pathway Integrative Analysis</em> and <em>Enrichment Analysis</em> modules.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The application is divided into three main sections: <strong>New Job</strong>, <strong>Find
                                Job</strong>, and <strong>Results</strong>. The <strong>New Job</strong> section allows
                            users to upload the required experimental data for multi-omics integration. Through the
                            <strong>Find Job</strong> section, users can retrieve the results of previous runs using the
                            corresponding job identifier. Finally, the <strong>Results</strong> section offers a variety
                            of tools for performing exploratory data analysis and multi-omics integration.

                            TurbOmics uses a structured data frame system composed of three types of tables:
                            <strong>experimental metadata</strong>, <strong>omic metadata</strong>, and <strong>omic
                                quantification</strong>. These tables must be provided in TSV format files for upload to
                            the platform.
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Experimental metadata:</strong> A table where each row represents a biological
                                sample and each column corresponds to an experimental factor (e.g., treatment,
                                pathology, batch information). The first column must contain the sample identifiers.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Omic metadata:</strong> A separate table must be provided for each omic type.
                                Each row should represent a biomolecule, with relevant information such as gene name,
                                UniProt ID, or biochemical class organized in columns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Omic quantification:</strong> A separate table must also be provided for each
                                omic type. These tables must follow a "long" format, where rows represent biomolecules
                                and columns represent samples.</li>
                        </ul>

                            The consistency and linkage between these tables rely on matching identifiers. Therefore, it

                                column headers (i.e., the first row) of the omic quantification tables.</li>
                            <li>The biomolecule identifiers in the first column of both the omic metadata and omic
                                quantification tables match exactly.</li>

                        <p>Normalization techniques are used to correct for systemic and technical variations that can
                            obscure biological signals and lead to misleading conclusions. TurbOmics provides two widely
                            used and flexible normalization methods:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Variance Stabilization Normalization (VSN):</strong> Quantitative data undergo
                                an affine transformation to bring measurements from different samples to a common scale
                                (<a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/vsn/inst/doc/A-vsn.html"
                                    target="_blank">VSN documentation</a>). A variance-stabilizing transformation is
                                then applied to make the variance independent of the mean.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Log2-median normalization:</strong> Quantitative data are transformed using a
                                binary logarithm (log‚ÇÇ), followed by median centering within each sample.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="mt-4" id="scaling">Scaling</h4>
                        <p>Different omics datasets often exhibit varying value ranges due to differences in
                            technological platforms and the normalization methods applied during data generation. These
                            disparities can compromise multi-omics integration, leading to distorted visualizations or
                            reduced interpretability in quantitative data representations (e.g., heatmaps). To address
                            this, TurbOmics provides an option to standardize omics data by setting the mean of each
                            biomolecule to 0 and the standard deviation to 1.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-4" id="missing-values">Missing Values</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p><strong>TurbOmics combines two strategies to balance information retention and missing
                                    value imputation.</strong> After uploading omic quantitative data, the platform
                                displays a line plot showing the number of retained biomolecules as a function of the
                                selected missing value fraction threshold. Users can interactively adjust
                                this threshold and observe in real time how many biomolecules are retained.</p>

                            <p>After filtering, users can choose from several imputation techniques to handle missing

                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The resulting annotations are integrated into the metabolomics metadata table and made
                            available in sections dedicated to multi-omics integration.</p>

                        <p>
                            To enable automated annotation, users must upload a metabolomics metadata table containing
                            the <em>m/z</em>, retention time (RT), and ionization mode (positive or negative) for each
                            feature (Figure 5A).
                            The <em>m/z</em> value and ionization mode are essential for annotation via CMM, while the
                            RT is used by the TPMetrics module to prioritize annotations based on correlation analyses
                            between features.
                            Users can further customize the annotation process by specifying parameters such as
                            parts-per-million (ppm) tolerances for <em>m/z</em>-based searches and selecting potential
                            adducts for both positive and negative ionization modes (Figure 5B).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            CMM compares the <em>m/z</em> values of detected features against in-house libraries and
                            external databases such as
                            <a href="https://www.hmdb.ca/" target="_blank">HMDB</a>,
                            <a href="https://www.lipidmaps.org/" target="_blank">LipidMaps</a>,

                            <a href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg/" target="_blank">KEGG</a>.
                            The resulting candidate annotations are then processed by the four modules of TurboPutative:
                            <strong>Tagger</strong>, <strong>REname</strong>, <strong>RowMerger</strong>, and
                            <strong>TPMetrics</strong>.
                            The final output, <strong>TPFilter</strong>, provides the most likely annotation for each
                            feature and is integrated with the user-supplied metabolomics metadata table.

                            The Multi-Omics Factor Analysis module enables the unbiased and integrative decomposition of
                            multi-omics quantitative data into latent factors. This module is based on the
                            <a href="https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/" target="_blank">MOFA</a> framework, which
                            identifies latent factors that capture the main sources of variation across the analyzed
                            datasets.
                            TurbOmics supports the visualization of sample subgroups and shared patterns across
                            different omics layers.

                            First, users can explore a color-coded table summarizing the factors computed by MOFA. This
                            table displays the percentage of variance explained by each factor in each omics dataset,
                            along with p-values from correlations between factor scores and metadata variables. This
                            facilitates the rapid identification of factors associated with biological conditions of
                            interest.

                        <p>
                            Users can further investigate specific biological conditions and factors of interest
                            directly within the TurbOmics platform. They can examine the distribution of factor loadings
                            for
                            each omics dataset and select the top-n biomolecules with the highest positive or negative
                            loadings for visualization in a heatmap. Notably, TurbOmics also enables users to identify
                            the biomolecules most strongly associated with each factor and to perform
                            Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) on each omics dataset using GO, KEGG, and Reactome
                            annotations.

                            The Enrichment Analysis module enables the identification of enriched functional categories
                            for each omics dataset in parallel.
                            This section allows users to run the GSEA algorithm simultaneously across transcriptomics,
                            proteomics, and metabolomics data,
                            facilitating the comparison of statistically significant pathways between these datasets.

                        <p>
                            Users must specify the biomolecule identifier column and select a metric for GSEA, such as
                            LogFC or t-statistic.
                            Additionally, PCA and MOFA loadings can be used as input metrics, enabling deeper analysis
                            of the components and factors computed in earlier modules.

                            For untargeted metabolomics data, enrichment analysis can be performed using the

                                rel="noopener noreferrer">mummichog</a> library.
                            The results are presented in an interactive and exportable table that includes the
                            biomolecules responsible for the enrichment of each category.

                        <p>
                            TurbOmics also supports custom enrichment analysis, allowing users to define and explore
                            their own functional categories.

                            The top panel allows the selection of the omics layer and the metric to be used for
                            enrichment. In the bottom part, users can select the enrichment results obtained using
                            different knowledge bases, which are displayed in the bottom table.
